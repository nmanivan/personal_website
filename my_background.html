					<p>
						My name is Narayan Manivannan, and I'm currently a Sophomore studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan College of Engineering.  I was born in Portland, Oregon, then moved to Novi, Michigan, where I stayed for most of my life with my family. I was first introduced to Computer Science my junior year of high school, and my love for the field has only grown.  I plan on working hard and learning as much as I can in school while also engaging in side projects and preparing for interviews.  My dream job is to work for Facebook, as its culture is centered on trust and teamwork, which I believe suits me well.  My primary goal is to lead a happy life in the future, and this will result from the passion and hard work I show in the present.

						I have swum from 6th grade to 12th grade on a club team called Spartan Aquatic Club and also on the Novi High School men's swim team from 9th to 12th grade.  Swimming has shaped my character immensely - especially high school swimming - teaching me values like work ethic, teamwork, and leadership.  Now, I am swimming on a recreational team called SWAM at the University of Michigan, where I swim solely for enjoyment.

						I have been exposed to music since I started playing piano at age 5.  I took lessons and played at competitions until I was 16, and since then I have been playing for fun.  I also picked up guitar at around 14 years old, and I have also been playing since then.  Playing piano and guitar is a way for me to destress and feel at peace if I have been working too hard. I plan to continue playing my whole life.
